# Discord Bumper Bot

This project is a selfbot designed to automatically bump a Discord server at regular intervals using the Discord API.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **.env File**: A `.env` file is needed for the bot to function properly. An example file, `x.env`, is included in this project.
   
   - **Step 1**: Rename `x.env` to `.env`.
   - **Step 2**: Open the `.env` file and fill in the value for the token (`TOKEN`), the guild id (`GUILD_ID`) and the channel id (`CHANNEL_ID`) with your botâ€™s authentication token.

2. The `.env` file should look like this:
   ```plaintext
   TOKEN= "YOUR_USER_TOKEN"
   GUILD_ID = "YOUR_GUILD_ID"
   CHANNEL_ID = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USER_TOKEN` with your actual user token.
   Replace `YOUR_GUILD_ID` with the id of the guild to bump.
   Replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` with the channel you want the script to bump in.

## Usage

Run the script to start the bot:
```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will automatically send a "bump" request every 2 hours (approximately).
